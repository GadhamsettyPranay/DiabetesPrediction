# DiabetesPrediction

Building a diabetes prediction model using the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm involves several steps.

PIMA Diabetes Dataset The PIMA Diabetes dataset is a popular dataset used for binary classification problems in machine learning. It contains data collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. In a binary classification problem, such as diabetes prediction, SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points of the two classes.

The following steps were involved in building the model.

Importing the Dependencies
Data Collection and Analysis
Data Standardization
Train Test Split
